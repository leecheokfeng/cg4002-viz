Download Vuforia package manually. Make sure you have the file under cg4002-viz/Packages/com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.18.4.tgz
This file was >100MB so couldn't fit on github.

'development' branch used to work but now not in use cos i messed it up (oops).
'fixed_dev' branch works, it's a dev branch.
'master' branch works and holds the latest version i used for demos.
'stereoscopic' branch holds an old stereoscopic version, used as reference.
